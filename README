Hello, This simple and cool project can make you a very old static and minimal RPG game base on pure HTML (or some css) and some other things
Last week, I saw a website that was a very cool RPG game base on HTML and it had some buttons to decide which way you want to continue the story
It was amazing how minimal was that website and how cool can be to just read and click!
And i made this project. It's so easy to just write a XML file and make HTML pages base on that, plus you have some cool options that makes it easy as writing your own story as a book!, if you like this project give a star to it.

- How to work:
Make a xml file like story.xml (there is a example one) and write your own story, you can use the example to write whatever you want
Run the python script to make a folder called `Game` for you, you can run the main .html file (base on your starting page) and enjoy
For changes, just change the xml file, re-generate the HTML files and run it

Have some fun, 2024 richard
